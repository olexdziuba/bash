Description:
This script allows you to ping all IP addresses within a specified network and displays the IP addresses that respond to the ping.

Instructions:

Clone the repository: $ git clone https://github.com/your-username/network-ping-script.git
Navigate to the script directory: $ cd network-ping-script
Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute the script: $ chmod +x ping_network.sh
Run the script: $ ./ping_network.sh
Follow the prompts to enter the network address and subnet mask. For example:
Enter the network address (e.g., 192.168.1.0): 192.168.1.0
Enter the subnet mask (e.g., 24): 24
The script will start pinging all IP addresses in the specified network.
Once the script finishes, it will display the IP addresses that respond to the ping as "Ping successful - <ip_address>".
You can find the complete results in the terminal output.
Note: Make sure you have the ipcalc tool installed on your system before running the script. If not, install it using the package manager specific to your operating system.

That's it! You can now use this script to ping IP addresses within a network and identify the ones that are active and responsive. Feel free to modify and customize the script according to your needs.
